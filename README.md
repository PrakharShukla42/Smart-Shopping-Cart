# IoT Smart Shopping Cart

## Project Overview
### **Revolutionizing the Shopping Experience with IoT & RFID**
The **IoT Smart Shopping Cart** is designed to simplify and enhance the shopping process by automatically adding products to a virtual shopping list when they are placed in the cart. By leveraging **RFID technology**, the system eliminates the need for manual scanning at checkout counters, reducing queues and saving time. The cart features an **OLED display** that provides real-time updates on selected items, their prices, and total cost, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.


## **Key Features**
âœ… **Automatic Product Detection**: Scans RFID-tagged items as they are placed in the cart.
âœ… **Real-time Display**: Shows product details and prices on an OLED screen.
âœ… **Unauthorized Item Detection**: Alerts users about unrecognized or restricted items.
âœ… **Billing Convenience**: Eliminates manual scanning at checkout counters.
âœ… **Future Expansion Possibilities**: Can integrate with mobile apps and digital payments.

## **How It Works**
ðŸ›’ **Step 1**: Power on the system â€“ the OLED screen displays a *WELCOME* message.
ðŸ›’ **Step 2**: As products are placed in the cart, the RFID reader scans their tags.
ðŸ›’ **Step 3**: The product name and price appear on the OLED screen.
ðŸ›’ **Step 4**: If an unauthorized item is scanned, an alert message appears.
ðŸ›’ **Step 5**: The customer proceeds directly to payment without the need for manual scanning.
